Outdoors have always been where I felt the most comfortable and I have had the opportunity to have roamed alot in my life.

I have always been an adventure chaser and apart from pure fun I have learnt alot from those experiences. Recently I thought it would be a good idea to document my experiences for looking back in the future. 

Hence I made this site, its a work in progress but I'll add content as and when I can. 

This site has tags for the type of travel and has posts arranged accordingly. There is also a map section , which has pointers on locations I have visited, presently only in India.

Right now, this is a simple enough site, but I hope to extend it more in the future. 

Anyways, happy reading, and if you want to get in touch with me, please contact me here: [abhishekbalam96@gmail.com](mailto:abhishekbalam96@gmail.com).
